The goal of this project is to create a cloud-based architecture for a
hospital ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system that effectively supports
a number of functional modules, such as patient records, laboratory
information system, HR management, inventory management, and billing and
financial management. In order to ensure cost effectiveness, scalability, and
high performance, the system must be able to serve several hospitals at once
while staying within stringent financial limitations.
